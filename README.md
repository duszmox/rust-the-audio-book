# Rust The Audio Book

Overview

- Purpose: Convert the Rust Book chapters in `book/src/*.md` into cleaned, narrated audio files.
- How: For each chapter, the app:
  - Replaces every fenced code block (`...`) with a short, listener‑friendly summary generated by Gemini.
  - Sanitizes the chapter text for TTS (removes links, headers/lists, HTML, code fences, backticks, some custom tags, and normalizes `scr/` → `source/`).
  - Splits long text into ≤ 3000‑character chunks at paragraph boundaries, then performs TTS for each chunk.
  - Merges all audio chunks back into a single playable audio file per chapter (WAV header rewrite for PCM/LINEAR16; MP3 concatenation when applicable).

Requirements

- Rust (stable toolchain) and Cargo
- Internet access
- Google Gemini API key with access to:
  - `gemini-2.5-flash` (text summaries)
  - `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-tts` (text‑to‑speech)

Setup

1. Ensure your `.env` file contains your Gemini key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Build the project:

```
cargo build --release
```

Usage

- Process all chapters in `book/src/`:

```
cargo run --release
```

- Process a single chapter:

```
cargo run --release -- book/src/ch01-02-hello-world.md
```

Outputs

- Audio files are written to the `audio/` directory.
- File name: `audio/<chapter>.<ext>` where `<chapter>` is the markdown file stem and `<ext>` is based on the returned/normalized MIME type:
  - LINEAR16/PCM → wrapped to proper WAV (`.wav`)
  - MP3 → `.mp3`
  - OGG → `.ogg`
  - Unknown → `.bin` (fallback)

What the app does (in detail)

- Code block summarization: Finds triple‑backtick blocks and replaces their content by calling Gemini `generateContent` on `gemini-2.5-flash` with a short, non‑jargony summary prompt.
- Text sanitization for TTS:
  - Removes Markdown links: `[text](url)` → `text`, `[text][id]` → `text`, drops autolinks `<https://...>` and bare URLs.
  - Removes reference link definitions like `[id]: https://...`.
  - Strips headings (`#`), list bullets (`- * +`), numbered lists (`1.`, `1)`), and leading blockquote markers (`>`).
  - Drops lines starting with `<Listing` / `</Listing>` and code fence lines (```).
  - Removes inline HTML tags/comments and backticks.
  - Replaces any `scr/` with `source/`.
  - Collapses excess blank lines to keep narration flowing.
- Chunking: Splits the sanitized text into ≤ 3000 characters, prioritizing paragraph boundaries; falls back to sentence end.
- TTS:
  - Calls `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-tts:generateContent` requesting audio.
  - If audio is returned as raw LINEAR16/PCM, wraps it into a valid WAV container for compatibility.
  - Logs timestamps and durations for each TTS chunk.
- Merging:
  - WAV/PCM: Parses headers, validates matching format, concatenates data, and writes a single correct WAV.
  - MP3: Concatenates frame streams (works in most players).

Handling rate limits and errors

- Automatic retries on 429/5xx with exponential backoff and respect for `Retry-After` when provided (up to 6 attempts).
- Clear error messages if a call ultimately fails.

Examples

```
cargo run --release -- book/src/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.md

```

Notes and limitations

- [ ] The transformed markdown is not written back to disk; it’s used only for TTS.
- [ ] Only triple‑backtick code fences are summarized; indented code blocks are ignored.
- [ ] Streaming (`streamGenerateContent`) is not used; if your account only allows streaming for TTS, extend the client to parse SSE and assemble audio.

Project layout

- `src/main.rs` — Implementation of scanning, sanitizing, Gemini calls, chunking, and audio merge.
- `Cargo.toml` — Dependencies (`reqwest`, `tokio`, `serde`, `dotenvy`, `regex`, `chrono`, etc.).
- `.env` — Must contain `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- `audio/` — Output directory for generated audio files.
